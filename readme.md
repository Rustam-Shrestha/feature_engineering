Data Distribution, Scaling, and Text Feature Engineering with Pandas and Scikit-learn
Overview
This notebook provides an in-depth exploration of critical techniques in data preparation for machine learning, focusing on analyzing data distributions, scaling numerical features, handling outliers, and processing text data to convert unstructured information into numerical features suitable for predictive modeling. These steps are foundational in feature engineering, as raw data often contains inconsistencies, noise, or formats that can degrade model performance. Effective feature engineering can significantly enhance model accuracy and generalizability, often outweighing the choice of algorithm itself. This guide assumes familiarity with basic Pandas operations (e.g., loading data, filtering) and introduces intermediate to advanced concepts with practical code examples to ensure reproducibility.
Key principles include:

Avoiding data leakage, where test set information inadvertently influences training, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates.
Handling different data types appropriately: numerical (continuous/discrete) for distribution analysis and scaling, and text for natural language processing (NLP).
Inspecting data upfront using methods like df.describe(), df.info(), and df.isnull().sum() to identify missing values, incorrect data types, or anomalies.
Understanding model assumptions (e.g., normality for linear models) and tailoring preprocessing to meet them.
Evaluating the impact of transformations on model performance through metrics like RMSE, accuracy, or cross-validation scores.

The goal is to transform raw, messy data into a clean, structured format that aligns with the assumptions of machine learning algorithms, ensuring robust and unbiased predictions.
Datasets Used

Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023: A comprehensive dataset of developer responses, including numerical features like Age, Years Experience, and ConvertedSalary, and categorical features like Gender. It is ideal for numerical feature engineering due to its real-world variability, such as skewed salary distributions and potential outliers.Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stephen137/stack_overflow_developer_survey_2023/main/data/survey_results_public_2023.csv.Load example: so_survey_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stephen137/stack_overflow_developer_survey_2023/main/data/survey_results_public_2023.csv').Subsets used: 

so_numeric_df: Contains only numerical columns for distribution analysis and scaling.
so_train_numeric and so_test_numeric: Train-test splits for demonstrating proper scaling and outlier handling without data leakage.Notes: Surveys often have missing values (use df.dropna() or imputation), and salary data may require cleaning due to currency symbols or commas.


U.S. Inaugural Addresses: A dataset of historical U.S. presidential speeches, used for text processing examples. It includes a text column with raw speech content and is assumed to be available as speech_df.Source: Can be sourced from public repositories (e.g., GitHub) or NLTK's inaugural corpus (from nltk.corpus import inaugural; speech_df = pd.DataFrame({'text': [inaugural.raw(fileid) for fileid in inaugural.fileids()]}), requires nltk installation).Subsets used:

train_speech_df: First 45 speeches for training text vectorizers.
test_speech_df: Remaining speeches for testing, ensuring no data leakage in text transformations.Notes: Text data requires preprocessing to handle historical language, special characters, and varying speech lengths.



Additional Dataset Considerations:  

Always verify data licensing and compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR for personal data like salaries).  
Split datasets early into training (e.g., 80%) and testing (20%) sets using from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split to simulate real-world model deployment and prevent overfitting. Example: train_df, test_df = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42).  
For text data, consider domain-specific preprocessing (e.g., removing proper nouns like president names in speeches).  
If datasets are large, subsample for visualization (e.g., df.sample(1000)) to reduce computational load.

Topics Covered
Understanding Data Distributions
Understanding the distribution of your data is critical before building machine learning models, as it reveals key characteristics like skewness (asymmetry), kurtosis (tailedness), multimodality (multiple peaks), and correlations between features. These insights guide preprocessing decisions and model selection, as different algorithms have distinct assumptions about data distributions.

Histograms: Visualize the frequency of data points in bins to assess the shape of the distribution (e.g., normal, right-skewed, bimodal). Use df.hist() or df['column'].hist() in Pandas with Matplotlib. Key parameters: bins (e.g., 30 for granularity), figsize for clarity. Example: so_numeric_df.hist(figsize=(10,8)); plt.show().Interpretation: Look for positive skew (right-tailed, common in salaries), negative skew (left-tailed), or multimodality. Limitations: Bin size affects appearance; too few bins hide details, too many create noise. Alternative: Use kernel density estimation (KDE) with sns.histplot(data=df, x='column', kde=True) for a smoother curve.Must-know: Skewness (df.skew()) quantifies asymmetry; values >0 indicate right skew, <0 left skew. Kurtosis (df.kurtosis()) measures tailedness; high values indicate heavy tails (outliers).

Boxplots: Summarize data via quartiles (Q1, median, Q3), interquartile range (IQR = Q3 - Q1), and whiskers (typically Q1 - 1.5IQR to Q3 + 1.5IQR). Outliers appear as points beyond whiskers. Use: so_numeric_df[['Age', 'ConvertedSalary']].boxplot(); plt.show().Interpretation: A long whisker indicates high spread; many outliers suggest cleaning needs. Use sns.boxplot(x='category', y='feature', data=df) for group comparisons (e.g., salary by gender).Must-know: Boxplots are robust to non-normality but may miss subtle distribution shapes; complement with histograms.

Pair Plots: Show scatter plots for all pairs of numerical features, with histograms or KDEs on diagonals. Reveals correlations, clusters, and non-linear relationships. Use: sns.pairplot(so_numeric_df, diag_kind='kde'). Add hue='categorical_column' to color by categories (e.g., job role).Limitations: Computationally expensive for large datasets or many features; subsample if needed (df.sample(1000)). Complement with correlation matrices: sns.heatmap(df.corr(method='pearson'), annot=True) for linear correlations or method='spearman' for monotonic relationships.Must-know: Correlation does not imply causation; check for multicollinearity (high correlations) before modeling, as it can destabilize linear models.

Why Normality Matters: Many models assume normality of features or residuals:  

Linear Regression: Assumes residuals are normally distributed for valid hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests for coefficients).  
Logistic Regression: Benefits from normality in continuous predictors for stable odds ratios.  
Neural Networks: Gradient descent converges faster with standardized, near-normal inputs.  
Distance-Based Models (e.g., KNN, SVM): Sensitive to feature scale and distribution, as they use Euclidean distance.Non-normal data can lead to biased coefficients, inflated errors, or poor convergence. Test normality with:  
Shapiro-Wilk test: from scipy.stats import shapiro; stat, p = shapiro(df['column']) (p < 0.05 rejects normality).  
QQ-plots: from scipy.stats import probplot; probplot(df['column'], plot=plt) (points off the line indicate non-normality).Tree-Based Models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting): Non-parametric, invariant to distribution or scale. They split based on thresholds (e.g., "Age > 30"), not distances, making them robust to skewness, kurtosis, or unscaled data. However, transformations can still improve interpretability or handle extreme values for trees.


Additional Must-Know:  

Use df.describe() for summary statistics (mean, std, min, max, quartiles).  
For time-series data, test stationarity (constant mean/variance) with Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller).  
For multivariate normality, use Mardia’s test (requires external libraries).  
Always visualize distributions before assuming normality; real-world data is rarely perfectly normal.  
If distributions vary by group (e.g., salary by country), analyze subgroups separately (df.groupby('country')).



Scaling Numerical Features
Scaling ensures features contribute equally to models, especially for algorithms sensitive to magnitude (e.g., KNN, SVM, Neural Networks). Without scaling, high-magnitude features like salary (in thousands) can dominate low-magnitude ones like age (in tens), skewing results.

Min-Max Scaling: Scales features to a fixed range, typically [0,1]: ( x' = \frac{x - \min(x)}{\max(x) - \min(x)} ). Preserves distribution shape but is sensitive to outliers, as they define min/max. Use MinMaxScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.Code:  
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaler.fit(so_numeric_df[['Age']])  # Fit on training data
so_numeric_df['Age_MM'] = scaler.transform(so_numeric_df[['Age']])
print(so_numeric_df[['Age_MM', 'Age']].head())

Use cases: Neural networks, image data (pixel values). Inverse transform with scaler.inverse_transform(). Must-know: Outliers can compress most data into a narrow range; consider clipping first.

Standardization: Centers data to mean 0, standard deviation 1: ( x' = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} ). Robust to outliers if combined with clipping; assumes approximate normality for best results. Use StandardScaler.Code:  
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(so_numeric_df[['Age']])
so_numeric_df['Age_SS'] = scaler.transform(so_numeric_df[['Age']])
print(so_numeric_df[['Age_SS', 'Age']].head())

Use cases: Linear regression, PCA, gradient-based models. Can produce negative values, unsuitable for contexts requiring non-negative data (e.g., image pixels).

Log Transformation: Reduces positive skewness by applying logarithmic (natural, base-10) or power transforms. Use np.log1p() for handling zeros or PowerTransformer for automated Box-Cox (positive data) or Yeo-Johnson (any data).Code:  
from sklearn.preprocessing import PowerTransformer
pt = PowerTransformer()
pt.fit(so_numeric_df[['ConvertedSalary']])
so_numeric_df['ConvertedSalary_LG'] = pt.transform(so_numeric_df[['ConvertedSalary']])
so_numeric_df[['ConvertedSalary', 'ConvertedSalary_LG']].hist()
plt.show()

Alternatives: Square root (np.sqrt()) for moderate skew, reciprocal (1/x) for heavy tails. Check skewness pre/post with df.skew(). Must-know: Transformations alter interpretability (e.g., log(salary) is less intuitive).

Additional Must-Know:  

Fit scalers on training data only to avoid leakage; transform test data with the same scaler.  
For sparse data, use MaxAbsScaler (scales to [-1,1] based on max absolute value).  
Robust scaling (RobustScaler) uses median and IQR, ideal for outlier-heavy data.  
Evaluate scaling impact with histograms or metrics like variance (df.var()).  
If features have different units (e.g., dollars vs. years), scaling is mandatory for most models except trees.  
Chain scaling with pipelines (from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline) for automation.



Handling Outliers
Outliers—data points far from the central tendency—can distort model training by inflating variances, skewing means, or affecting distance-based calculations. Detection and handling are critical for robust models.

Quantile-Based Removal: Removes or caps extremes, e.g., top/bottom 5%. Simple but arbitrary; risks data loss.Code:  
quantile = so_numeric_df['ConvertedSalary'].quantile(0.95)
trimmed_df = so_numeric_df[so_numeric_df['ConvertedSalary'] < quantile]
so_numeric_df[['ConvertedSalary']].hist()
plt.show()
plt.clf()
trimmed_df[['ConvertedSalary']].hist()
plt.show()

Alternative: Winsorize (cap at quantile) with scipy.stats.mstats.winsorize().

Statistical Outlier Removal: Removes points beyond k standard deviations (k=3 covers ~99.7% of normal data).Code:  
std = so_numeric_df['ConvertedSalary'].std()
mean = so_numeric_df['ConvertedSalary'].mean()
cut_off = std * 3
lower, upper = mean - cut_off, mean + cut_off
trimmed_df = so_numeric_df[(so_numeric_df['ConvertedSalary'] < upper) & (so_numeric_df['ConvertedSalary'] > lower)]
trimmed_df[['ConvertedSalary']].boxplot()
plt.show()

Alternative: IQR method (Q1 - 1.5*IQR, Q3 + 1.5*IQR) for non-normal data.

Train-Test Considerations: Compute thresholds on training data only; apply to test data to avoid leakage.Code:  
train_std = so_train_numeric['ConvertedSalary'].std()
train_mean = so_train_numeric['ConvertedSalary'].mean()
cut_off = train_std * 3
train_lower, train_upper = train_mean - cut_off, train_mean + cut_off
trimmed_df = so_test_numeric[(so_test_numeric['ConvertedSalary'] < train_upper) & (so_test_numeric['ConvertedSalary'] > train_lower)]

Rarely remove outliers from test data, as it may not reflect real-world scenarios. Instead, cap or impute.

Additional Must-Know:  

Impute outliers as means/medians or model them separately (e.g., anomaly detection with Isolation Forest).  
In high dimensions, use Mahalanobis distance for multivariate outliers.  
Monitor data loss; if >10%, investigate sources (e.g., measurement errors vs. genuine rare events).  
Advanced: Use robust models (e.g., Huber Regression) or robust statistics (median-based).  
Visualize pre/post outlier removal to confirm impact (histograms, boxplots).



Text Data Processing
Text data is unstructured and requires preprocessing to convert into numerical vectors for machine learning. Challenges include high dimensionality, noise (e.g., punctuation), and context preservation.

Text Cleaning: Standardizes text by removing noise and ensuring consistency.Steps: Remove non-alphabetic characters (str.replace('[^a-zA-Z]', ' ')), convert to lowercase (str.lower()), strip extra whitespace (str.strip()).Code:  
speech_df['text_clean'] = speech_df['text'].str.replace('[^a-zA-Z]', ' ')
speech_df['text_clean'] = speech_df['text_clean'].str.lower()
print(speech_df['text_clean'].head())

Advanced: Apply stemming (nltk.PorterStemmer) or lemmatization (nltk.WordNetLemmatizer) to reduce words to roots; remove stopwords (nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')).

High-Level Feature Extraction: Computes metadata like character count, word count, and average word length.Code:  
speech_df['char_cnt'] = speech_df['text_clean'].str.len()
speech_df['word_cnt'] = speech_df['text_clean'].str.split().str.len()
speech_df['avg_word_length'] = speech_df['char_cnt'] / speech_df['word_cnt']
print(speech_df[['text_clean', 'char_cnt', 'word_cnt', 'avg_word_length']])

Use cases: Exploratory analysis, feature augmentation.

Word Count Vectorization: Creates a Bag-of-Words model, counting word frequencies across documents. Use CountVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text. Parameters: min_df (minimum document frequency), max_df (maximum), max_features (limit total features).Code:  
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
cv = CountVectorizer(min_df=0.2, max_df=0.8)
cv_transformed = cv.fit_transform(speech_df['text_clean'])
cv_array = cv_transformed.toarray()
print(cv_array.shape)
cv_df = pd.DataFrame(cv_array, columns=cv.get_feature_names_out()).add_prefix('Counts_')
speech_df_new = pd.concat([speech_df, cv_df], axis=1, sort=False)
print(speech_df_new.head())

Output: Sparse matrix (documents × unique words). Must-know: High dimensionality; use sparse matrices to save memory.

TF-IDF Vectorization: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency weighs words by importance: ( tf-idf = tf \times \log(\frac{N}{df}) ), where ( tf ) is term frequency, ( N ) is total documents, and ( df ) is documents containing the term. Reduces impact of common words (e.g., "the").Code:  
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
tv = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=100, stop_words='english')
tv_transformed = tv.fit_transform(speech_df['text_clean'])
tv_df = pd.DataFrame(tv_transformed.toarray(), columns=tv.get_feature_names_out()).add_prefix('TFIDF_')
print(tv_df.head())

Inspect top words: sample_row = tv_df.iloc[0]; print(sample_row.sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)).

N-Grams: Captures word sequences (e.g., bigrams, trigrams) for context. Example: "not happy" vs. "happy".Code:  
cv_trigram_vec = CountVectorizer(max_features=100, stop_words='english', ngram_range=(3, 3))
cv_trigram = cv_trigram_vec.fit_transform(speech_df['text_clean'])
print(cv_trigram_vec.get_feature_names_out())
cv_tri_df = pd.DataFrame(cv_trigram.toarray(), columns=cv_trigram_vec.get_feature_names_out()).add_prefix('Counts_')
print(cv_tri_df.sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head())

Must-know: N-grams increase dimensionality exponentially; balance with max_features.

Train-Test Text Transformation: Fit vectorizers on training data, transform test data to avoid learning from test vocabulary.Code:  
tv = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=100, stop_words='english')
tv_transformed = tv.fit_transform(train_speech_df['text_clean'])
test_tv_transformed = tv.transform(test_speech_df['text_clean'])
test_tv_df = pd.DataFrame(test_tv_transformed.toarray(), columns=tv.get_feature_names_out()).add_prefix('TFIDF_')
print(test_tv_df.head())

Must-know: Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in test data are ignored; consider subword tokenization for robustness.

Inspecting Features: Identify top words/phrases by frequency (cv_df.sum()) or TF-IDF scores (tv_df.iloc[i].sort_values()). Ensures features are meaningful.

Additional Must-Know:  

Handle OOV with custom vocabularies or embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).  
Reduce dimensionality with PCA/SVD (sklearn.decomposition) or feature selection (chi-squared, sklearn.feature_selection).  
Advanced: Use tokenizers (e.g., spaCy, HuggingFace) for complex texts.  
Evaluate feature quality with downstream model performance (e.g., classification accuracy).



Key Considerations

Model Robustness: Tree-based models (Random Forests, XGBoost) are invariant to distributions and scaling but may benefit from transformations for interpretability or handling extreme values. Non-tree models require careful preprocessing to meet assumptions.
Data Leakage: Always fit scalers, vectorizers, and thresholds on training data. Transforming test data with training parameters ensures realistic evaluation. Leakage inflates performance metrics, leading to poor generalization.
Bias and Ethics: Check for biases in distributions (e.g., salary disparities by gender or region) using group-by analysis (df.groupby('group').describe()). Ensure fair preprocessing to avoid perpetuating biases.
Dimensionality: Text features can create thousands of columns; use max_features, min_df, or dimensionality reduction to manage complexity.
Evaluation: Post-engineering, retrain models and compare metrics (e.g., RMSE for regression, F1-score for classification) using cross-validation (sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score). Monitor bias/variance trade-offs.
Pipelines: Automate preprocessing with sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline to streamline scaling, vectorization, and modeling. Example: Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), ('model', LinearRegression())]).
Imbalanced Data: If classes are imbalanced (e.g., rare job roles), use stratified splits (train_test_split(..., stratify=df['target'])) or oversampling (SMOTE, imblearn.over_sampling).
Computational Efficiency: For large datasets, use sparse matrices for text features, subsample for visualizations, or parallelize with joblib.
Domain Knowledge: Incorporate context (e.g., remove speech-specific terms like "fellow citizens" in inaugural addresses) to improve feature relevance.
Monitoring: Track data loss from outlier removal or missing value handling; excessive loss (>10%) may indicate underlying data quality issues.

Additional Must-Know Topics

Feature Selection: After engineering, select top features using methods like mutual information (sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_classif), recursive feature elimination (RFE), or model-based importance (e.g., Random Forest feature importances). Reduces noise and overfitting.
Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation (sklearn.model_selection.KFold) to assess preprocessing impact robustly. Example: 5-fold CV to evaluate scaling effects.
Handling Missing Values in Context: If not covered earlier, impute numerical data with mean/median (df.fillna(df.mean())) or advanced methods (KNNImputer). For text, impute with placeholders (e.g., "unknown") or model-based embeddings.
Time-Series Considerations: If data is temporal (e.g., speech dates), avoid future leakage by splitting chronologically (e.g., earlier speeches for training, later for testing).
Evaluation Metrics: Choose metrics aligned with the task (e.g., precision/recall for imbalanced classification, R² for regression). Use confusion matrices (sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix) for classification insights.
Feature Engineering Validation: Test transformations with simple models (e.g., Logistic Regression) before complex ones to isolate preprocessing effects. Compare raw vs. engineered features.
Documentation: Maintain clear records of preprocessing steps (e.g., scaler parameters, removed outliers) for reproducibility. Use comments or Jupyter markdown cells.
Error Handling: Anticipate issues like non-numeric data in numerical columns (pd.to_numeric(df['column'], errors='coerce')) or division by zero in transformations.
Scalability: For big data, use distributed frameworks like Dask or Spark (pyspark.ml) for preprocessing. Example: dask.dataframe for large CSV files.

Code Integration
All techniques are implemented using Python with Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Ensure dependencies are installed: pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn. For text processing, optionally install NLTK (pip install nltk; import nltk; nltk.download('inaugural')). Combine steps in a pipeline for production-ready workflows. Example:  
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, FunctionTransformer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
numeric_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler())])
text_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer(max_features=100))])
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(transformers=[
    ('num', numeric_transformer, ['Age', 'ConvertedSalary']),
    ('text', text_transformer, 'text_clean')
])
